Project Overview
The Four-Port Switch Project introduces the principles of data modeling, object-oriented programming, and verification methodology. The labs are designed to build upon each other, culminating in a verification-ready four-port switch model.

Lab 1: Simple Data Class Declaration
This lab focuses on creating a simple data class to represent packets. You will learn:

How to declare classes

Defining properties and methods

Basic object-oriented programming constructs

Lab 2: Simple Randomization and Constraints
In this lab, you’ll explore:

Random variable declaration

Applying constraints to limit the random values

Validating randomized object behavior

Lab 3: Static Properties and Methods (Optional)
(Optional) This lab demonstrates:

Defining and using static variables

Creating static methods to track or manage shared data

Lab 4: Inheritance and Polymorphism
You will learn:

How to use inheritance to extend base classes

Applying polymorphism for method overriding

Reusability and modular design

Lab 5: Component Hierarchy
This lab introduces component-based modeling:

Building hierarchical structures

Organizing verification components

Understanding simulation components and their interactions

Lab 6: Completing the Verification Component
(Assumed based on partial view) This final lab involves:

Integrating all developed components

Running a complete verification testbench

Validating the Four-Port Switch design
